    <h2 style="color: white;">1.How do i start choosing which plant to buy?</h1>
    <p1 style="color: white;">People often make the mistake of choosing which plant they want before they know where it should go.

        The truth is, you should decide where you want your plant before you decide which plant to buy.
        
        This is because different plants will thrive in different spots, depending on the amount of space and light available.</p1><br>
    <h2 style="color: white;"> 2 .What is the difference between bright, medium and low light plants?</h2> 
    <p2 style="color: white;">right light plants will do well in direct or strong sunlight for the most part of a day.

        Medium light plants should stay out of the direct sunlight. They should be placed in a bright room and will enjoy partial or filtered sunlight.</p2><br>
